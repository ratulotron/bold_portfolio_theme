            Ratul Minhaz is a Bangladeshi software crafter currently living in Berlin, Germany. Over the
            past 4
            years he had explored different facets of software development. At the moment he is focused on
            building
            data solutions and bridging product development with data science.

          </header>
          <p>Ratul
            Minhaz, or less known as his birth name Minhazur Rahman, was born and raised in Dhaka,
            Bangladesh.
            As a curious kid,
            along with his brother he used to break and rebuild all their toys. Eventually in high school
            when
            he stumbled upon a
            C++ book, he found his new hobby of building software. It was a no brainer for him to get into a
            computer science
            program for undergrad, however the initial kickback from hardcore CS theoretical courses took of
            a
            few notches off of
            his excitement. He found inspiration once again when he joined the local chapter of Mozilla
            Foundation and did community
            engagement for Student Ambassadors and Firefox OS Dev programs for couple of years. He started
            using
            Ratul Minhaz as his
            community persona during the talks he took, as a combination of his nick name and first name. He
            joined a marketing
            agency as a web developer during his third year at the university and started his career as a
            software crafter. After
            working on full stack projects for a while his concentrated on backend development only, making
            Python and Django his
            main choice of tools. He considers himself a life long learner and loves to explore product
            development as an art method
            rather than being stuck with one specific area only.
